This page is where I keep the 'postcards' from Emptiness Theme users. If you found the Emptiness Theme useful and would like to somehow thank me, you can, by:
  # Taking a picture of something/anything from your local neighbourhood, the city you live in.
  # And emailing it to blah@cliffano.com along with a short description.

Thanks for using Emptiness Theme :).
