This page is where I keep the 'postcards' from Emptiness Theme users. If you found the free Emptiness Theme useful and would like to somehow help me with this little project... (you can consider this donating to the project, instead of money, an e-postcard will do) :)

You can email me (blah@cliffano.com) a picture of your local neighbourhood or the city you live in along with a short description about the picture. I reckon it will be interesting to see the many places where the users are from.

These are the one(s) I've received so far:

*[http://www.redlemoncreative.com Genevieve] from Portland, Oregon, USA.*

"Attached is my photo of the Steel Bridge which spans the Wilamette River in Portland, Oregon. I like to ride my bike over this bridge to get to downtown Portland."

Thanks for sending me the picture(s) and for using Emptiness Theme :), very much appreciated.
