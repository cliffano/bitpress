If you found Emptiness Theme useful for you and would like to somehow thank me, it would be nice if you can email me (blah@cliffano.com) a picture of something from the city you live in. I reckon it would be a great way to get a glimpse of the many places on planet earth.

Please note that this is totally optional so don't feel that you have to do it :).
