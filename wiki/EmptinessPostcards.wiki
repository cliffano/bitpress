This page is where I keep the 'postcards' from Emptiness Theme users. If you found the free Emptiness Theme useful and would like to somehow help me with this little project... (you can consider this donating to the project, instead of money, an e-postcard will do) :)

You can email me (blah@cliffano.com) a picture of your local neighbourhood or the city you live in along with a short story about the picture. I reckon it will be interesting to see the many places where the users are from.

These are the one(s) I've received so far:

"Attached is my photo of the Steel Bridge which spans the Wilamette River in Portland, Oregon. I like to ride my bike over this bridge to get to downtown Portland."

*[http://www.almostbohemian.com David] from San Diego, California, USA.*

"When I first moved to San Diego from Chicago, I realized how much I missed the urban life, the gritty life of city living. The first year or more I drifted to different neighborhoods and beach towns, thinking I'd find my paradise. Recently I built a studio in a neighborhood called Barrio Logan, which is near downtown San Diego. I go on longer walks around the city now and I pass this car often. It's usually at the same intersection and I appreciate how the car is for sale and the building is closed. It feels like it could be Detroit, or Chicago, or Los Angeles, or San Diego. The myth of Southern California and the beauty that is life."
