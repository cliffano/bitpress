This page is where I keep the 'postcards' from Emptiness Theme users. If you found Emptiness Theme useful and would like to somehow thank me, you can, by simply emailing me (blah@cliffano.com) a picture of your local neighbourhood or the city you live in along with a short description about the picture.

These are the one(s) I've received so far:

*[http://www.redlemoncreative.com Genevieve] from Portland, Oregon, USA.*

"Attached is my photo of the Steel Bridge which spans the Wilamette River in Portland, Oregon. I like to ride my bike over this bridge to get to downtown Portland."

Thanks for sending me the picture(s) and for using Emptiness Theme :), much appreciated.
