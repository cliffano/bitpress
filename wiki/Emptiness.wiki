==FAQ==
  * Q: How to change the header image?
    A: Create your own header image (file name must be header.jpg) with the exact dimension 500 pixels in width and 265 pixels in height. Replace the original header file wp-content/themes/emptiness/header.jpg with your own header.jpg .
  * Q: How to remove the "by author_name" and other post details on the left side of each post?
    A: Open up emptiness/index.php file. Find the word "the_author_posts_link()", that's pretty much the post details area on the left of each post. You can delete the lines that you donâ€™t want there.
  * Q: Why is there a huge space between the header and the post?
    A: This happens when your widgets are placed on the Header Left sidebar. Move them to Body Right sidebar.

==Widget Sidebars==
There are 4 types of widget sidebars:
  * Header Left Sidebar - the left area of the header
  * Header Right Sidebar - the right area of the header
  * Body Right Sidebar- the right area of the body
  * Post Left Sidebar - the left area of each post
