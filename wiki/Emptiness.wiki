==FAQ==
  * Q: How to change the header image?
    A: Starting from version 1.1, you can upload your own header image by using the form located at WordPress Dashboard -> Appearance -> Custom Header -> Upload New Header Image, browse and upload the header image. Note that this feature requires [http://php.net/manual/en/image.installation.php PHP GD library], if you can't see the uploaded header image, it's quite likely that the library hasn't been installed.
    If you're using version 1.0 or older, create your own header image (file name must be header.jpg) with the exact dimension 500 pixels in width and 265 pixels in height. Replace the original header file wp-content/themes/emptiness/header.jpg with your own header.jpg . However, be careful not to overwrite your own header.jpg when you upgrade the theme later on in the future.

  * Q: How to remove "by author_name" and other post details on the left side of each post?
    A: Open up emptiness/index.php file. Find the word "the_author_posts_link()", that's pretty much the post details area on the left of each post. You can delete the lines that you donâ€™t want there.
  * Q: Why is there a huge space between the header and the post?
    A: This happens when either the Header Left sidebar or the Header Right sidebar has a lot of content that takes up space longer than the height of the header image. It's usually caused by widgets that are placed on Header Left sidebar or Header Right sidebar, you should move them to Body Right sidebar instead.
  * Q: On IE6, why does the right sidebar get pushed down below the body?
    A: This only happens when you have a post containing text or image wider than the width of the body (by default it's 500px). So you can either modify the wide content to fit 500px, or modify style.css and assign larger width (width attribute for div#container and div.main).

==Widget Sidebars==
There are 4 types of widget sidebars:
  * Header Left Sidebar - the left area of the header
  * Header Right Sidebar - the right area of the header
  * Body Right Sidebar- the right area of the body
  * Post Left Sidebar - the left area of each post
